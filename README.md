# Ingest Trello JSON into C# objects
[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. It helps teams stay on top of tasks and
find out what over members in the team are working on. It is a great tool for Agile development and project 
management. Trello boards can be exported to JSON. This project is a prototype to read JSON and save data into
C# objects (deserialization of JSON). Data from these C# objects can be serialized in a text file, or database, 
although serialization to a CSV or database has not been implemented in this project. Users of this prototype
can implement their serialization. This prototype serves only as a tutorial for deserialization of JSON export
from Trello using C# (.NET Framework 3.5 or above)
